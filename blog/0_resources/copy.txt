TED 2012: Will Technology Save Us All, or Will It Tear Us Apart?

&#8220;When we look at the wonders that we have created, 
is it the fire that lights up the world or the one that burns it down?&#8221;
          
It&#8217;s an appropriate question to ask at the Technology Entertainment and Design conference, 
the annual gathering of some of the world&#8217;s biggest thinkers 
and exposition of advancements in science and technology. 
It may be especially apt from the man who posed it on Tuesday, 
TED curator Chris Anderson.

We Don&#8217;t Have a Mobile Payment Problem; We Have a Mobile Shopping Problem

Mobile payment systems feel like magic. 
Wave a smartphone in the air with a wandlike flourish, 
or tap two of them together like Captain Marvel&#8217;s bracelets, 
and invisible currency changes invisible hands.


Contact-free and tap-and-go payments powered by NFC (near-field communication) give great demo. 
They&#8217;re all the rage at this year&#8217;s Mobile World Conference in Barcelona, 
where Spanish bank La Caixa just rolled out an ambitious citywide payment system. 
But even at a Google Wallet-friendly Starbucks, waiting in a 10-minute line 
only to pull a phone out of our pocket and fumble with it 
rather than a credit card barely feels like the future.

Twitter Brings Promoted Tweets and Accounts to Mobile Apps

On Tuesday, Twitter announced that sponsored tweets and accounts 
would soon be rolling out to the timelines, searches and suggested follows 
seen by users of the social network&#8217;s mobile client apps. 
Promoted Accounts will appear immediately in user searches and suggestions 
with the latest updates to Twitter&#8217;s official mobile apps for Android and iOS.

Twitter&#8217;s Promoted Products are the primary way the company earns money, 
each a kind of contextual advertisement that aims as much as possible 
to blend into the service&#8217;s overall flow. Promoted tweets, 
trends and accounts have been appearing in both search and user timelines 
on Twitter&#8217;s mobile website for some time, 
and the desktop version of Twitter.com before that.
