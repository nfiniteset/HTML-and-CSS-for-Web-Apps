          <p>&#8220;When we look at the wonders that we have created, 
            is it the fire that lights up the world or the one that burns it down?&#8221;
          </p>
          
          <p>It&#8217;s an appropriate question to ask at the Technology Entertainment and Design conference, 
            the annual gathering of some of the world&#8217;s biggest thinkers 
            and exposition of advancements in science and technology. 
            It may be especially apt from the man who posed it on Tuesday, 
            TED curator Chris Anderson.

        <div class="article-body">
          <p>Mobile payment systems feel like magic. 
            Wave a smartphone in the air with a wandlike flourish, 
            or tap two of them together like Captain Marvel&#8217;s bracelets, 
            and invisible currency changes invisible hands.
          </p>
          
          <p>Contact-free and tap-and-go payments powered by NFC (near-field communication) give great demo. 
            They&#8217;re all the rage at this year&#8217;s Mobile World Conference in Barcelona, 
            where Spanish bank La Caixa just rolled out an ambitious citywide payment system. 
            But even at a Google Wallet-friendly Starbucks, waiting in a 10-minute line 
            only to pull a phone out of our pocket and fumble with it 
            rather than a credit card barely feels like the future.

        <div class="article-body">
          <p>On Tuesday, Twitter announced that sponsored tweets and accounts 
            would soon be rolling out to the timelines, searches and suggested follows 
            seen by users of the social network&#8217;s mobile client apps. 
            Promoted Accounts will appear immediately in user searches and suggestions 
            with the latest updates to Twitter&#8217;s official mobile apps for Android and iOS.
          </p>
          
          <p>Twitter&#8217;s Promoted Products are the primary way the company earns money, 
            each a kind of contextual advertisement that aims as much as possible 
            to blend into the service&#8217;s overall flow. Promoted tweets, 
            trends and accounts have been appearing in both search and user timelines 
            on Twitter&#8217;s mobile website for some time, 
            and the desktop version of Twitter.com before that.
