Hello all,

I want to leave you with a reminder of the concepts we covered tonight—and we covered a lot!

You may find it helpful to review this stuff every couple of days.
Keep the concepts fresh in mind.

And practice! That's the only real way of improving!


Elements
=======

We reviewed that HTML pages are composed of elements.
Elements consist of an opening tag, a closing tag, and content.
An elements' content may be text, or other elements, or both.
Opening and closing tags have matching tag names.
Elements may also have attributes.

Here's what an element looks like:
<p id="intro" class="pullquote">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.</p>

This...........................................................is the element's:
<p>                                                           opening tag
</p>                                                         closing tag
p                                                               tag name
id="intro" class="pullquote"         attributes
intro                                                       id
pullquote                                               class
It was the best...                             content


Id and class
=========

Id and class are two common and useful attributes.
Classes may describe the 'kind of thing' an element is— 
what conceptual set it belongs to.
Classes may also be used to describe the state an element is in—
a selected item in a list may be assigned a class of "selected".
Elements may have any number of classes, separated by spaces.

The id attribute uniquely identifies an element.
No two elements on a page may have the same id.
Each element may have only one id.

If you were to mark up everyone in the class as elements,
you might assign everyone a class of "person",
and each would be assigned an id that identified them uniquely.
Id's may be people's names or social security numbers.


CSS
===

We reviewed that CSS documents are composed of rules.
Rules consist of selectors, and properties set to values.

Here's and example of a CSS rule:

p {
  font-faily: Helvetica;
}

This..........................is the rule's:
p               selector
font-faily      property
Helvetica       value

Selectors
=======

Use selectors to choose elements on a page to style.
We reviewed selecting element's by tag name, class, and id.

Properties
=======

Properties change the appearance of elements.
They end in semi-colons. 


We covered even more. Can you think of things I didn't cover here?
Maybe I'll have time to complete the list.

Good luck.
